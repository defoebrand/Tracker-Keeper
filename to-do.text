Active Record lets you eager load any number of associations with a single Model.find call by using an array, hash, or a nested hash of array/hash with the includes method.
13.1.1 Array of Multiple Associations
Article.includes(:category, :comments)

This loads all the articles and the associated category and comments for each article.
13.1.2 Nested Associations Hash
Category.includes(articles: [{ comments: :guest }, :tags]).find(1)

This will find the category with id 1 and eager load all of the associated articles, the associated articles' tags and comments, and every comment's guest association.
