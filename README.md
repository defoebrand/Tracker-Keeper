# Tracker Keeper

> A web app to track any sort of transaction you need to. Transactions could be as simple as the amount you spent at the store or the amount of time spent working, but you can also track multiple types of transactions so you can watch your calories, time sleeping, time working, and money spent. Users are allowed to create unique amount types and attach unique group icons in order to best represent the type of transaction they are tracking. Each user's experience can be custom tailored to their needs.
